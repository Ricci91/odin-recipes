    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <h2>French Toast</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pure maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Bourbon whiskey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>5 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 cups dry whole-grain or challah bread cubes (see From the Editor, below)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Toasted Pecan Butter</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped pecans</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

    
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease 4 (8 to 10 ounce) ramekins. Whisk together milk, eggs, maple syrup, bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Add bread. Toss to combine. Divide among prepared ramekins. Chill, covered, at least 2 hours or up to overnight. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make Toasted Pecan Butter: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spread pecans on a rimmed baking sheet. </li>
        <li>Toast in the preheated oven, stirring once or twice, until lightly browned and fragrant, 12 to 15 minutes. Watch closely so they donâ€™t burn. Let cool to room temperature. </li>
        <li>Pulse butter, brown sugar, and vanilla in a food processor until combined. Add cooled pecans. Pulse until mixture reaches desired consistency. Chill Toasted Pecan Butter in an airtight container up to 1 month. </li>
        <li>To assemble: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). For streusel, stir together flour and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; stir in pecans. Sprinkle streusel over bread mixture in ramekins.  </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and a knife inserted into centers comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Serve warm with Toasted Pecan Butter and garnish with powdered sugar. </li>
    </ol>
